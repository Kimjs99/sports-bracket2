# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev        # Start dev server (Vite, http://localhost:5173)
npm run build      # Production build → dist/
npm run preview    # Preview production build

```

Deployment: push to `master` → GitHub Actions builds → GitHub Pages.

## Architecture

**Stack:** React 19 + Vite 8 + Tailwind CSS v4. No routing library — screens are rendered conditionally by a single `currentScreen` string in global state.

### State management

Two separate React contexts:

1. **`AppContext`** (`src/App.jsx`) — wraps `useReducer(reducer, initialState)`. All tournament data, screen navigation, and UI state live here. Consumed via `useContext(AppContext)` → `{ state, dispatch, asyncDispatch, importedLevel }`. `importedLevel` is set transiently (4 s) when a share-link tournament is imported on mount.

2. **`AdminContext`** (`src/contexts/AdminContext.jsx`) — auth-only state (isLoggedIn, username, modal open/close, pending action queue). Consumed via `useAdmin()` hook. Sits outside `AppContext` and wraps the whole app.

### Screen navigation

**Auth gate in `App.jsx`:** when not logged in, always renders `OrgSelectScreen` (org picker/register/login) regardless of `state.currentScreen`. After login, renders the normal screen tree.

**Guest URL (`?view=<slug>`) always wins (v0.7.1):** when the param is present, `GuestView` (read-only) renders regardless of auth state — a logged-in admin sees the guest screen too, never admin UI. The only admin entry point is GuestView's header button, which strips `?view` and reloads: with a stored session it lands on the admin tree ("관리자 화면"), otherwise on `OrgSelectScreen` ("관리자 로그인").

`state.currentScreen` is one of `SCREENS.*` (`org_select | home | setup | draw | matchplay | dashboard`). `App.jsx` renders the matching component with `{screen === SCREENS.X && <X />}`. Navigate by dispatching `SET_SCREEN` or `BACK_TO_HOME`.

`BACK_TO_HOME` and `SELECT_TOURNAMENT` are async — handled by `asyncDispatch` in `App.jsx`, which calls Supabase then falls back to localStorage before dispatching to the reducer.

### Storage layer (`src/utils/storage.js`)

**Supabase-primary (v0.4.0+):** Supabase is the source of truth for authenticated users. localStorage is a session cache only — wiped on login/logout.

- `saveTournament(data)` — saves to localStorage immediately, then fire-and-forgets to Supabase (with `user_id` from auth session)
- `loadAllTournaments()` — when authenticated: always trusts Supabase result (even empty array), clears + repopulates localStorage. Unauthenticated → returns `[]` (fully private).
- `loadTournament(id)` — tries Supabase, falls back to localStorage
- `clearLocalCache()` — wipes all localStorage tournament data; called on login/logout to prevent cross-org leakage

localStorage keys: `tournament_ids_v2` (ID array), `tournament_data_{id}` (full object per tournament).

**Supabase RLS on `tournaments` table:** `user_id = auth.uid()` for SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE. Unauthenticated access returns nothing. `tournaments` table has `user_id UUID` and `org_id UUID` columns (added in v0.4.0).

**Important:** `Home.jsx` loads tournaments from `state.tournamentList` (populated via `asyncDispatch`). `Draw`, `MatchPlay`, `Dashboard` use `state.tournament`.

### Admin auth (`src/utils/adminStorage.js`) — Multi-tenant (v0.4.0)

**Per-org synthetic email:** `admin+{slug}@school-bracket.app`. Each school registers independently.

- `loadOrganizations()` — public SELECT from `organizations` table; returns `[{ id, name, slug, created_at }]`
- `registerOrg(name, slug, password, regCode)` — **registration-code gated (v0.7.3)**: pre-validates the code via `validate_registration_code` RPC (fast-fail before creating the auth user), then `supabase.auth.signUp`, then creates the org via `register_organization` RPC which re-validates the code server-side (SECURITY DEFINER against the policy-less `app_settings` table). Direct INSERT into `organizations` is blocked (the `orgs_owner_insert` policy was dropped). Throws `'INVALID_CODE'` / `'ALREADY_EXISTS'`. The actual code lives only in the DB — never commit it to the repo.
- `loginOrg(slug, password)` — `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword`; returns `{ user, org }` or `null`
- `signOutAdmin()` — `supabase.auth.signOut()`
- `subscribeAuth(callback)` — wraps `onAuthStateChange`; used in `AdminContext` to restore session on mount

**`AdminContext`** stores `isLoggedIn`, `username` (org name), `orgSlug`, `orgId`. On login: `clearLocalCache()` called to wipe any stale cross-org data.

**`requireAdmin(action)`** pattern: if already logged in → executes `action()` immediately; if not → stores it as `pending`, opens modal.

**`AdminLoginModal`** (v0.4.0): simplified to **logout-only** UI — shown when tapping the GlobalBar admin button while logged in. Login happens via `OrgSelectScreen → OrgLoginModal`.

**`OrgSelectScreen`** (`src/components/OrgSelectScreen.jsx`): lists all orgs (public read), search, click → `OrgLoginModal` (password only, email derived from slug), `RegisterForm` for new orgs.

**Multi-tenant architecture:** `organizations` table links `slug` + `name` → `user_id` (Supabase Auth). `tournaments` table has `user_id` column; RLS `user_id = auth.uid()` enforces per-org isolation. Run `SUPABASE_MIGRATION.sql` when setting up a new Supabase project.

### Tournament data shape

`gameFormat` is `'tournament'` | `'league'` | `'group_tournament'`. The bracket structure differs per format:

**tournament / league:**
```js
{
  meta: { id, schoolLevel, gender, sport, gameFormat, totalTeams, bracketSize, byeCount, createdAt, seed, status },
  teams: string[],
  bracket: { rounds: Round[] },
  notices: Notice[],
  history: ReshuffleEntry[],
}
```

**group_tournament** (auto-selected when league + 7+ teams):
```js
{
  meta: { ...same base fields..., groupCount, advancePerGroup, knockoutSize, phase: 'group'|'knockout' },
  teams: string[],   // original unshuffled order
  bracket: {
    groups: [{ id, name, teams: string[], rounds: Round[] }],
    knockout: null | { rounds: Round[] },
  },
  notices: Notice[],
  history: ReshuffleEntry[],
}
```

`Round: { roundNum, name, matches: Match[] }`
`Match: { id, home, away, homeScore, awayScore, winner, isBye, date, time, venue, status, completedAt }`

Match ID conventions: group matches = `gA_r1m1`, knockout matches = `kr1m1`.

### Game format logic

**Manual placement (v0.7.0):** `setupMeta.placement` = `'random'` (default) | `'manual'`, persisted as `meta.placement`. Manual → `generateBracket(teams, seed, { ordered: true })` skips the shuffle (teams placed in list order); for group_tournament the Setup UI collects per-team group assignments and passes `manualGroups` in the `GENERATE_BRACKET` payload. `RESHUFFLE` always randomizes and flips `placement` back to `'random'`; `RESET_BRACKET` preserves manual placement (`rebuildGroupStage` keeps group rosters, clears results).

**tournament:** `submitMatchResult` propagates winner to the next round slot (`Math.floor(matchIdx / 2)`, home if even / away if odd).

**league (≤ 6 teams):** `submitLeagueResult` updates the match only (no propagation); draws allowed (`winner = null`). `calcLeagueStandings(teams, rounds)` sorts by pts → goal diff → goals for.

**group_tournament (≥ 7 teams, auto-upgraded from league):**
- `calcGroupConfig(teamCount)` — `advancing = nextPowerOfTwo(max(4, ceil(n/3)))`, `groupCount = advancing / 2`. Example: 15 teams → 4 groups → 8강.
- `generateGroupTournament(teams, { manualGroups })` — default uses `Math.random()` shuffle (not seeded) so each generation is truly random; `manualGroups` (string[][]) uses the given group rosters verbatim (manual placement).
- `isGroupStageComplete(groups)` — all non-bye matches done.
- `buildKnockoutFromGroups(groups, advancePerGroup)` — cross-seeds advancing teams: `[A1, B2, C1, D2, B1, A2, D1, C2]` so same-group teams can only meet in the final.
- `submitGroupTournamentResult` — auto-calls `buildKnockoutFromGroups` after the last group match; editing any group match nulls out the entire knockout (standings may have changed).

Draw.jsx tab sets per format:
- tournament: `[대진표, 일정입력]`
- league: `[순위표, 경기일정, 일정입력]`
- group_tournament: `[조별 순위, 조별 경기, N강 대진(disabled until complete), 일정입력]`

MatchPlay.jsx:
- group_tournament: section tabs per group (draws allowed) + knockout section (draws forbidden), knockout auto-appears when group stage completes.
- tournament / league: round tabs.

Home.jsx (public dashboard) bracket tab:
- group_tournament → `GroupDashboardView`: standings + results per group card, knockout BracketTree when available.
- tournament / league → `BracketTree`.

`SELECT_TOURNAMENT` in reducer maps `group_tournament` back to `'league'` in `setupMeta` so the Setup UI shows the correct game format when editing.

### Constants (`src/constants/index.js`)

- `SCHOOL_LEVELS = ['초등', '중등', '고등']`
- `GENDER_TYPES = ['남성', '여성', '혼성']`
- `SPORTS` — 22 items including special sports (보치아, 슐런)
- `GAME_FORMATS` — `tournament`, `league`, `link` (link = disabled/준비 중)
- `MATCH_STATUS` — `scheduled`, `bye`, `done`

### Dark mode

Tailwind v4 class-based dark mode via `@custom-variant dark (&:where(.dark, .dark *))` in `index.css`. The `.dark` class is toggled on `<html>` by `App.jsx`. Always use `dark:` Tailwind variants — never `@media (prefers-color-scheme)` directly.

### Bracket download (`src/components/ui/DownloadMenu.jsx`)

`dom-to-image-more` + jsPDF are **dynamically imported** (lazy-loaded) on first use. `captureBlob(element, type, quality)` uses `scale: 2` and hardcodes `bgcolor` per theme (`#1e293b` dark / `#ffffff` light).

### Share links — unified into guest URLs (v0.7.1)

Sharing is guest-URL-only (`?view=<slug>`, read-only, server-backed). The per-tournament `?t=` snapshot links are no longer created — the former "공유 링크" button in Home now copies the guest URL. **Legacy `?t=` links** are handled in `App.jsx`: decode via `readShareParam()`, look up the org slug from `meta.orgId` (`loadPublicOrgSlugById`, public SELECT), then `location.replace` to `?view=<slug>` (param is simply dropped if the org can't be resolved). `buildShareUrl`/`encodeTournament` remain in `shareUtils.js` only for legacy decode support and tests.
